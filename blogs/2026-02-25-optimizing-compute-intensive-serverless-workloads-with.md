Customers use AWS Lambda to build Serverless applications for a wide variety of use cases, from simple API backends to complex data processing pipelines. Lambda's flexibility makes it an excellent choice for many workloads, and with support for up to 10,240 MB of memory, you can now tackle compute-intensive tasks that were previously challenging in a Serverless environment. When you configure a Lambda function's memory size, you allocate RAM and Lambda automatically provides proportional CPU power.
